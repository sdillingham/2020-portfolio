title: "The Design Loop and The Hero’s Journey"
teaser: "What Joseph Campbell can teach us about design process"

Signal Sciences' design team started 2020 by codifying our design process. We borrowed heavily from Buzzfeed’s [Design Loop](https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/introducing-buzzfeeds-design-process-4fefbdcd83ea), modifying it to fit our needs:

This is a well-established way of thinking about what good design process looks like at the micro level. Lots of design and product orgs converge on a circular process that feeds back into the next iteration of the loop. As designers we like the loop for that exact reason: it de-linearizes our process, placing the emphasis on continuous learning rather than arriving at a final destination.

Beginning to lean on the design loop as the way to articulate our design process made me examine what’s going on inside that loop. I noticed that it resembles another loop I’m fond of:

For those who know Joseph Campbell’s work on mythology, please excuse a couple paragraphs of crude explanation. For everyone else, let’s start with a description from the man himself:

> “The basic motif of the hero journey [is] leaving one condition, finding the source of life to bring you forth in a richer or more mature or other condition.“

Campbell identified the hero's journey as a common template across all mythological traditions. It's an archetype that helps illuminate a path for humanity to follow when faced with inevitable challenges. Following the path of the hero's journey transforms our fear into a a state of heightened connectedness and fullness of potential.
