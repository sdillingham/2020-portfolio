I'm delighted to share the news that [KPCC took home awards for all six of our EPPY nominations](http://www.scpr.org/news/2013/10/30/40106/kpcc-takes-home-6-eppy-awards/) this year. I'm so proud of the work of all the talented individuals involved.

I don't place much meaning in trophies, but these awards do mark a moment in time for KPCC - a kind of corner we have turned. When I joined KPCC in 2011, we were one among hundreds of public radio stations struggling to thrive in a digital world. Today, we consistently ship interesting and well-executed digital editorial features and products.

Big congrats to [Bryan Ricker](http://bryanricker.com/), [Chris Keller](http://blog.chrislkeller.com/), [Jon White](http://jonwhitestudio.com/), [Deepa Fernandes](https://twitter.com/deepaKPCC), [Grant Slater](http://grant-slater.com/), [Mae Ryan](http://www.maeryan.com/), and [Maya Sugarman](http://www.mayasugarman.com/). I'm honored to work with you.

Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't link to the winning projects: [AudioVision](http://audiovision.scpr.org/), [Fire Tracker](http://projects.scpr.org/firetracker/), [Bilingual Learning](http://projects.scpr.org/bilinguallearning/), and [KPCC.org](http://scpr.org/).
